Using create-react-app with Spring Boot

## About

This is a very basic sample project that illustrates a ReactJS frontend,
generated with
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app),
being served up by a [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
application. You could use this as a template for your own projects.
